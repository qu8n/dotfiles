# Scripts

Scripts in this directory or its subdirectories can be ran from anywhere. (They
are programmatically added to PATH in `zsh/paths.zsh`.

## Steps to creating a new script

1. Create a script file in this directory or a subdirectory, e.g. `./work/myscript.sh`
2. At the top of the file, add a shebang to let computer know which program to run
script with, e.g. `#!/bin/zsh`
3. Make the script executable with `chmod +x ./work/myscript.sh`
