# Scripts

Scripts in this directory or its subdirectories (except `raycast/`) can be ran
from anywhere as they were added to the PATH in `.zsh/paths.zsh`.

## Steps to creating a new script

1. Create a script file in this directory or a subdirectory, e.g. `myscript.sh`
2. At the top of the file, add a shebang to let computer know which program to run
script with, e.g. `#!/bin/zsh`
3. Make the script executable: `chmod +x myscript.sh`
