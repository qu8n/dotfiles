# Steps to creating a new script
1. Create a script file in this directory, e.g. `myscript.sh`
2. At the top of the file, add a shebang to let computer know which program to run script with, e.g. `#!/bin/zsh`
3. Make the script executable: `chmod +x myscript.sh`
4. This entire dir and its subfolders have been added to PATH, so we can run the script by calling `myscript.sh` from anywhere
