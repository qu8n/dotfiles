Powerful keyboard customizer for macOS.

I (under)use this tool for two purposes:

- Mapping Caps Lock to Escape for easier Vim usage
- Locking my laptop's keyboard when I'm using my [Glove80](https://www.moergo.com/collections/glove80-keyboards),
so I can use and rest the latter on top of the former when traveling.
