# dotfiles

Configurations for my software development environment.

This repo is public because [dotfiles are meant to be forked](https://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).
A good environment setup can be a game-changer for productivity,
and I hope someone can find useful tidbits here.

Interested in tracking your dotfiles with Git? I recommend the
[Git bare repository strategy](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).
