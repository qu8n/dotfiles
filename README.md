# dotfiles

A collection of configuration files for my software development environment.

I made this repo public as inspired by Zach Holman's article [Dotfiles Are Meant to Be Forked](https://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/). A good environment setup can be a game-changer for productivity, and I hope this repo can help someone.

Interested in tracking your dotfiles with Git? I recommend the [Git bare repository strategy](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).
