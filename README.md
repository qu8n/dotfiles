# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Feel free to [fork](https://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/)
and make it your own, or look around and take what you like.

I've added comments and READMEs throughout so you can quickly understand what
each item (command, script, app, etc.) does. Enjoy! üèÑ

## File structure

This dotfiles repository's root mirrors my `$HOME` directory. By default, I
organize configs in their own directories inside `$HOME/` to keep things tidy.

There are also READMEs in each directory to explain what's inside, like what
the tool is, what I use it for, useful commands, etc.

## (In)frequently asked questions

### How do you track your dotfiles?

I track mine following the [Git bare repository strategy](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles)
for its simplicity. There are many amazing tools out there, so I recommend you
to check them out before deciding. As a starting resource, see [this guide](https://dotfiles.github.io/).
