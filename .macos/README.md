# MacOS settings

Below are my personal MacOS settings, described in plain English.

I didn’t write a full [automated script](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/main/.macos)
because I rarely get a new Mac. Spending hours automating something I can do
in minutes didn’t seem worth it.

Also, see [Maybe Don't Bother Scripting Some macOS System Preferences](https://assert.cc/posts/maybe-dont-script-macos-prefs/).

## My MacOS settings

- Keyboard
  - Key repeat rate: fastest
  - Delay until repeat: shortest
- Mouse
  - Tracking speed: 6 (with 1st level as 1)
